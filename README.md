# PrometheusExporter

PrometheusExporter allows you to aggregate custom metrics from multiple processes and export to Prometheus.

Unlike PushGateway it is designed to perform transformations and aggregations on the metrics it collects.

It can be used when a single "logical" process has multiple "workers" processes that gather metrics.
For example: unicorn workers may wish to export information about the number of requests made and so on.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'prometheus_exporter'
